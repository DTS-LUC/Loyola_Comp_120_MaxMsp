!.	additional modulation of parameters such as amplitude modulation (tremolo) or 
frequency modulation (pitch bend/vibrato/FM synthesis)


2.	User control, via MIDI, over pitch, duration (sustain points on the ADSR envelope),

Commentary: Tell me what your patcher does, what its features and user-controlled 
parameters are. Tell me also if you are basing your ideas on other work you might have 
looked at (cite your sources!), or give credit to any collaborators. Commentary could 
be a separate text file or might be included in your patcher.
