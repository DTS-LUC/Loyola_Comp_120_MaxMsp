This max patch takes user input from a keyboard using the notion object with the slider object. The output from the notion is used by both the slider and adsr objects. The adsr object takes values that are first scaled and then outputs them as frequencies. The attributes of the wave can be modified within the object, described by the comments. The kslider passes along midi values that are filtered by an if loop. That loop is triggered by the velocity of the note. The midi frequencies then pass through the motf object and are converted to frequency values. The frequencies then pass through different harmonics that can be adjusted by the user, or set by the preset control. This patch also features a master volume that can be adjusted using keyboard controls. As well as, a low frequency operator that can be adjusted as well.
